/**
 * THE OPERATOR'S CASES, side by side (2026-10-02). Every case the operator found in a practice film
 * lives here together, so a fix for one cannot quietly undo another — which is exactly what happened
 * when "a list item is never a part" (for Dale's engraved board / house sign) drew Ruth's "a bear paw
 * there" as the whole quilt. The rules under test are general; these lines are only the examples
 * that proved each one.
